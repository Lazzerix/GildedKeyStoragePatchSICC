A patch for [Gilded Key Storage](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/865/gilded-key-storage) that allows you to insert the Golden Keychains, the Golden Keycard Holder, and the Secure Key Box into the S I C C Pouch.

To install, extract the zip file into you Tarkov folder

Fun facts: I initially made this mod shortly before 4.0.0. 
As I finished updating it, I saw someone asking if there was a way to put the keychains in the SICC pouch.
And as I have it, I might as well share it
